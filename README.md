# gensites

JavaScript library containing metadata about genealogy websites. The original intent is to contain display information
(site names, urls, and descriptions) for websites supported by [gensearch](https://github.com/rootsdev/gensearch)
and [genscrape](https://github.com/rootsdev/genscrape)  but I'm sure we can come up with more uses for it.
